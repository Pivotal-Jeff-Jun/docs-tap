### <a id='1-8-0-new-features'></a> v1.8.0 New features by component and area

This release includes the following changes, listed by component and area.

#### <a id='1-8-0-vscode'></a> v1.8.0 Features: Tanzu Developer Tools for Visual Studio Code

- You can create `portforwards` with the [Tanzu: Portforward](vscode-extension/using-the-extension.hbs.md#workload-port-forward)
  action from the pop-up menu in the Tanzu panel. This enables you to easily access the application
  when iterating locally from a local URL (via **Tanzu: Portforward**) or a Knative URL (for the web
  type of workloads) from the Tanzu panel.

#### <a id='1-8-0-intellij'></a> v1.8.0 Features: Tanzu Developer Tools for IntelliJ

- You can create `portforwards` with the [Port Forward](vscode-extension/using-the-extension.hbs.md#workload-port-forward)
  action from the pop-up menu in the Tanzu panel. This enables you to easily access the application
  when iterating locally from a local URL (via **Port Forward**) or a Knative URL (for the web
  type of workloads) from the Tanzu panel.

#### <a id='1-8-0-app-sso'></a> v1.8.0 Features: Application Single Sign-On

- The authorization server can auto-discover upstream identity provider
  configuration from
  `AuthServer.spec.identityProviders[].openID.configurationURI`.
  For more information, see [Identity providers for Application Single Sign-On](app-sso/how-to-guides/service-operators/identity-providers.hbs.md).

- The `userinfo` endpoint of an upstream identity provider is called when
  it's known and configured with the scope `openid`. That means user information
  is retrieved for non-standard providers.

- Scopes in the token response are filtered according to the roles filtering
  defined on the `AuthServer`.

- Advertises the Application Single Sign-On version on components:

  - The controller workloads are annotated with
    `sso.apps.tanzu.vmware.com/version`.
  - `AuthServer`-owned workloads are annotated with
    `sso.apps.tanzu.vmware.com/version`.
  - Authorization servers report the version by using the endpoint
    `FDQN/actuator/info`.

- Shows an error message when attempting unsupported, Relying Party (RP)-Initiated Logout.

- Shows an improved error message when using `localhost` in
  `ClientRegistration.spec.redirectURIs`.

- Bundles the latest `bitnami/redis:7.2.4`.

- Supports Kubernetes v1.29.

#### <a id='1-8-0-aws-services'></a> v1.8.0 Features: AWS Services

- Adds the service Amazon MQ for RabbitMQ. To enable the new service, set `rabbitmq.enabled: true`
  in your `aws-services-values.yaml`. For more configuration options, see
  [Package values for AWS Services](aws-services/reference/package-values.hbs.md).

- Adds the package value `crossplane.role_arn`. Users can specify a `role_arn`, which causes
  the Provider pods to run as a service account that is mapped to the corresponding IAM role in AWS.

- Updates upbound/provider-aws from v0.39.0 to v0.46.0.

#### <a id='1-8-0-bitnami-services'></a> v1.8.0 Features: Bitnami Services

- Updates all Compositions to use function pipelines rather than Crossplaneâ€™s default patch and transform.
  New instances created using a class claim are now composed using the new Compositions.
  There is no change to how the resulting composed service instances operate.
  There is no impact to existing instances.

#### <a id='1-8-0-cert-manager'></a> v1.8.0 Features: cert-manager

- Updates cert-manager to v1.13.3. For more information, see the [cert-manager release notes](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/tag/v1.13.3) in GitHub.

#### <a id='1-8-0-crossplane'></a> v1.8.0 Features: Crossplane

- Updates [Universal Crossplane](https://github.com/upbound/universal-crossplane) to v1.14.5-up.1
  For more information, see the [Upbound blog](https://blog.crossplane.io/crossplane-v1-14/).

- Updates provider-helm to v0.16.0.

- Updates provider-kubernetes to v0.11.0.

- Adds support for composition functions. Composition functions are beta in for Crossplane v1.14.
  For more information, see the [Upbound Documentation](https://docs.crossplane.io/latest/concepts/composition-functions).

- Adds the patch and transform function. Users who want to use function pipelines in their Compositions
  can use this function without having to explicitly install it.

#### <a id='1-8-0-service-bindings'></a> v1.8.0 Features: Service Bindings

- Updates [servicebinding/runtime](https://github.com/servicebinding/runtime) to v0.7.0.
  This update fixes the issue of `ServiceBinding` not immediately reconciling when `status.binding.name`
  changes on a previously bound service resource.

#### <a id='1-8-0-services-toolkit'></a> v1.8.0 Features: Services Toolkit

- Updates reconciler-runtime to v0.15.1.

#### <a id='1-8-0-scst-store-ri'></a> v1.8.0 Features: Supply Chain Security Tools - Store

### <a id='1-8-0-resolved-issues'></a> v1.8.0 Resolved issues

The following issues, listed by component and area, are resolved in this release.

#### <a id='1-8-0-COMPONENT-NAME-ri'></a> v1.8.0 Resolved issues: Service Bindings

- Resolved an issue in which `ServiceBinding` is not immediately reconciled when `status.binding.name`
  changes on a previously bound service resource.

#### <a id='1-8-0-scst-store-ri'></a> v1.8.0 Resolved issues: Supply Chain Security Tools - Store

- This release fixes the issue with expired certificates where you must restart the metadata-store pods when the internal database certificate is rotated by cert-manager.
You will no longer see this issue with the default internal database, but the solution does not cover the case of an external database.

- Artifact Metadata Repository now properly sets the `hasNextPage` to `false` when there are
no more items to be retrieved during a paginated query. This fixes the issue
where the last page always returns an empty list.
